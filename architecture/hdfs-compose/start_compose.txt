#In the directory where is present the yaml run the following commands
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d --force-recreate 

# Check that everything was setup properly below
# You should see multiple containers
# There should be a nodemanager, resourcemanager, 
# historyserver, 5 different datanodes, and a namenode
docker ps

# Go into the namenode container to run bash commands from it
docker exec -it namenode bash

# In the namenode container, create a directory called "input"
mkdir input

# Create a text files to store 
echo "Hello World" >input/f1.txt

# Then we'll create an input directory on HDFS
# If you receive an error about connecting to the namenode,
# simply wait a few minutes before trying again.
# Docker is still probably taking a while to build
# and connect all the containers.
hadoop fs -mkdir -p input

# Here, we'll put the text file into the datanodes on HDFS
hdfs dfs -put ./input/f1.txt input

# Let's ensure that the file was stored by our HDFS into 3 replicas each;
hdfs fsck input/f1.txt -files -blocks -locations

# To remove all your containers for any reason or after you are done,
# cd into your docker-hadoop folder and run all the commands below 
# without the hash symbol
